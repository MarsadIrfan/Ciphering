# Python Ciphering and Recursion Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that were created while studying and practicing concepts from Al Sweigart’s excellent programming book.

The projects include implementations of:
- Classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigenère, Transposition)
- Encryption/decryption exercises
- Practice scripts based on cipher
  
These scripts were developed as part of my own learning journey, inspired by and adapted from the books listed below.
